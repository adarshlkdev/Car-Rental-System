The Car Rental System, utilizing core Java and OOP, manages car rentals efficiently. It employs encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for secure, modular, and flexible handling of vehicle bookings and transactions.

Our Dashboard looks like. Here we have three options :


1.) Rent a Car


2.) Return a Car


3.) Exit

Suppose if we choose option 1 then system will ask our name & shows the list of avaliable cars
Every car have three attributes :

1.) Car Id

2.) Car Brand

3.) Car Name 

Then it will ask the car id & no of rental days of the car.
